                          <h3>Since LinkedIn Security suddenly seems to have forgotten how to unrestrict linkedin accounts within a timely fashion because it's been over 11 days now of nothing but undue process in restrictions.</h3>
                          <cite>Forgetting how, well it's obvious this "forggetting of how to unrestrict" is by means done from Amazon Legal, given how it was so desperate in finding ways to outwit Dr. Liu
                          that it called the FBI to go give Dr. Liu a scare even though Dr. Liu told Amazon Legal that he was working with the FBI since Amazon Legal is obvously at a stage of pre-emptive motions in 
                          retaliation courses towards Ziping Liu and that Ziping Liu says don't do it it wont' be wnat you think you wil gain from such actions. 
                          I am not what you think I am: below Andy jassy or Jeff bezos as a person. Of course it would be such a case that Amazon Legal now is just that desperate to try to 
                        somehow, <b>still</b>, in their deluded minds as arch-angles for God Andy and his son Adam that Ziping Liu doesn't exist and Ziping Liu's medical leaves 
                    that he needs to get his disability issues resolved since I guess it's hard to actually understand that Ziping Liu has a disabilities, as you can see from the 
                medications he takes for his ailments, and such be issues like this happening</cite>
                            Notice of billable payments to collect from for all Billers: here's another entity to send to collections for billing: LInkedIn they owe us ${

                        And so we would like to express our sincere apoligies for the delays in our plans, it's very
    difficult to do IT PRESS, RESEARCH, and SECURITY <cite>(Because of course the FBI is too scared to
    provide adequate security for ZIPING LIU; and it's simply a fairytale of a true tale of stupidity and idiocy by so
    called Andy a father of 2 - well thanks to him he's also the father of the New Panama Papers
    BORN OUT OF NONE OTHER THAN the savage wastelands of the Amazonian
    egregious jungles,</cite> I don't give a damn how rich YOU ARE BEZOS - if you can't perofrm your role and expectiations set forth by operational stands, 
    and if you can't resolve an issue from an employee 
    that isn't even that hard of an executive level of cirifical error to solve, 
    then why are you in your role and position because it's been 90 days and what ahve we done?
    You ahve lead the ERC Amazon to have achieved nothing, no progress and by the way that is a huge demoralizing 
    effect on your employees with faile dleaderships towards resolutions in midst problems;
    so you are literally leading in the opossite direction that your leadership priciples define, 
    one being "<a href="https://aboutamazon.me/implicit" target="_blank">leading with empathy</a>" which is not implicit or expolicitly shown wherein.
    And so great I'm glad you can pay for an infinite amount of attorneys  to 
    have to tell you to sit around and do nothing; but money is NEVER
    compensation for stupid - IN CASE YOU FORGOT MONEY IS JUST A BUNCH OF CLOTH
    SCRIPTS AND TINY SLIPS AT THE END OF THE DAY, and as of right now there's a lot
    of stupid with a lot of CEO's and Founders right now, in tow with so called JD Armies and
    yet when they see Ziping, what do they do? They book it into the woods.) and also as a customer
    satisfaction gauranteed policy we would like to at this time offer a re-release of an
    archived website from July 4th 2022, in the meantime as compensation for the wait

    Writing and other content (including but not limited to comments, videos, and stuff) written or produced by Ziping Liu or ZIPING LIU may be in a form of satire (including but not limited to usage of profanity) and not reflective of the author(s)‚Äôs state of mind. Excluding words of ‚Äúlove‚Äù or empathic nature, satire not applicable. Regarding, words of ‚Äúfaith‚Äù and/or ‚Äúhope‚Äù, satire may be applicable when ‚Äúfaith‚Äù and/or ‚Äúhope‚Äù cannot be retained in good faith with all parties involved.

    Through augmentation, self-pioneering-hope then creates synergy for unconditional-love. Because hope implies a chance of failure. Yet, blind-hope then means, the destination need not matter. Ergo, unconditional-love is then retained, if and only if, blind-faith exists as well by way of Harmony~‚òØÔ∏è through pioneering-new-hope.
