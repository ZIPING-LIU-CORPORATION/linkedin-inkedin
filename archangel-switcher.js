    `      <p>I don't give a damn <i>and neither does God be damned to give a damn as a hypothetical</i>, about how rich YOU ARE BEZOS - if you can't perform your role and expectations, 
    and execute out my FMLA medical leave without retaliation and without adverse actions,
    as set forth by operational stands, because I guess we keep forgetting why Amazon Legal freaked out, and the root
    reason is because they messed up my medical leave. It's that simple. And yes, in order to "fix" this mess,
    they retaliated against me and then commited vioaltions in the American Disability Act, 
    FMLA Act, Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Fair Labour Act, and the Forced Labor Act, to just name a few.
    And as a reminder, by what means? Well by preending my FMLA medical leave never was issued out and 
    approved, and pretending that sending Law enforcement officers,
    to MY FUCKING HOUSE AT 11:45 PM CST, TO TELL ME THAT
    IS THE RIGHT ACTION AND MATURE ACTION, AND THE LP'S GUIDED LEARSHIP ACTION TO EXECUTIVE AND MOTION
    OUT THROUGH THEIR BY LAWS OF ORGANIZATION. AND NO I AM NOT AT ALL AND WAS NOT SACRED BY SUCH A
    CHILDISH BABY BOOMER ATROCITY. I AM FUCKING ANGRY. 
    IT'S 90 DAYS. WHAT DO YOU WANT? YOU WANT ME TO SERVE YOU? TO BE FUCKING HONEST WITH YOU,
    THE FBI, THE CIA, AND I, WE DON'T HAVE FUCKING TIME TO SERVE MOTIONS ON SOMETHING AS STUPID,
    INSANE, AND PATHETIC, AND SCHIZO-AFFECTIVE VIA NARCISSIM AND PSYCHOPATHIC CHARACTERISCS FROM 
    BABY BOOMER BEZOS AND ANDY JASSY THE FATHER OF SO CALLED TWO. I don't give a damn hwo much of a father or man you think you are Andy jassy: - if you can't perform your role and expectiations set forth by operational stands - such as like
    Marty Walsh, 
    and if you can't resolve an issue from an employee 
    that isn't even that hard of an executive level of cirifical error to solve, 
    then why are you in your role and position because it's been 90 days and what ahve we done?
    You ahve lead the ERC Amazon to have achieved nothing, no progress and by the way that is a huge demoralizing 
    effect on your employees with faile dleaderships towards resolutions in midst problems;
    so you are literally leading in the opossite direction that your leadership priciples define, 
    one being "<a href="https://aboutamazon.me/implicit" target="_blank">leading with empathy</a>" which is not implicit or expolicitly shown wherein.
    And so great I'm glad you can pay for an infinite amount of attorneys  to 
    have to tell you to sit around and do nothing; but money is NEVER
    compensation for stupid - IN CASE YOU FORGOT MONEY IS JUST A BUNCH OF CLOTH
    SCRIPTS AND TINY SLIPS AT THE END OF THE DAY, and as of right now there's a lot
