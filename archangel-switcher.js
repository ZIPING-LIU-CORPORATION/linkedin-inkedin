     now have any credibility to still hold those
    positions as leaders? Because real leaders knwo how to action out my wages and action out my medical leaves and get me my rightful positoin at Amazon.com, because right now, 
    who has just shown the world, and the world not as the public world (I would rather want to not  have the public know fully and become aware for their sake of emotions not felt in 
      absolute confusion as I am right now), the world as in all the leaders and or rightful counterparts of your stake hodlers of Amazon? Because now they realize wow Amazon VP's and CEO's are staffed
      with a bunch of Harvard AB Majors of actual non-educated and non-rational based children that aren't even chlidren at this point they are just parasites. 
      You went to  a college, and got a degree, at Harvard, in AB, and you seem to not undersatnd how to at all be self aware, and
      know the importance of: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CrOL-ydFMI" target="_blank">is this water?</a>

    reason is because they messed up my medical leave. It's that simple. And yes, in order to "fix" this mess,
    they retaliated against me and then commited vioaltions in the American Disability Act, 
    FMLA Act, Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Fair Labour Act, and the Forced Labor Act, to just name a few.
    And as a reminder, by what means? Well by preending my FMLA medical leave never was issued out and 
    approved, and pretending that sending Law enforcement officers,
    to my house, at 11:45 PM CST, is some type of right you have above mine, and that's not even the core of the issue,
    the core of the issue is YOU<sup>TM</sup> thinking you have some right given to you by all powers of the universe that you fully understand and know of,
    and that you can take someone's life and shorten it, like how you did by mine, and my leave and my body... How dare <a href="https://ziping.love/goodfaith" target="_blank">you think of yourself</a> as with hands righteous enough to then violate my body and soul in such ways?</p>
