       [On-This-Day-3-Part-3] - <cite style="font-size:11pt; line-height:0.9;
                    "> - Thanks for randomly selecting a button as a corporate point of priviledge given once, one time only, per day and no more allotments for anyone below a STATE.GOV Tier-1 Class 2 Citizen, for the Daily poll ID: On-This-Day-3 Prologue Part 3, and special thanks to the Speaker for the random untraceable button press. I agree with you but the public welfare is a bit uncertain. And I also have to take into account the random votes by our board so we are still at this point undecided between, A or B, as random cohices on a random poll, so we are going to say, all polls will now have a third choice, C, to accommodate for uncertainties. Thank you.

<sub>Side note for Amazon Disability Leave and ERC and Amazon Payroll: I need to get my wages paid and my medical leaves actioned, it's now bee ongoing: 150 days of actual: <b>ZERO</b> medical recovery and rest had for my disability and also including ZERO medical treatments done because you guys decided to retaliate against me while I was on FMLA and still am ON STD and/or FMLA leave... that is a huge violation that is not okay. Get it handled I need my F*** MONEY GOD ANDY, ajassy.cn/god</sub>
<p style="font-size:9.75pt; font-weight: 300; line-height: 0.95;">
  Side Note for Amazon Executive Control and Government Federal Departments Especially the DOL.GOV: Perhaps I didn't make this clear enough with thefbi.us/crime  So to state again as re-emphasis, I am on FMLA leave, and was supposed to be, and still am. This is at this point harming my phsyical health. I'm not sure why it is still 90 days ongoing, now 150 days total ongoing to say the least, of nothing resolved. Also, I want to point out, I have updated the stakeholder letter to fully include details on this issue: https://liu.academy/stakeholderletter I don't know what you guys are doing at Amazon DLS but part 4 is a email to Amazon DLS, so why don't we respond to that Amazon DLS??? AND AMAZON ERC AND ANDY AND JEFF? JEFF? IF YOU WANT TO CONTINUE AS ACCORDINGLY IN YOUR FAVOR THAN I SSUGEST YOU HANDLE THINGS BECAUSE YOU ARE A BAD APPLE SUSPECT RIGHT NOW. I need money to pay for my medical services hello? And if you are thinking what the FBI POPO told me on May 20th via a script read verbatim from what Amazon Legal wrote, "why don't you stop causing trouble and go pray to a Juris Doctor Priest about it," please kindly go F*** yourself.
